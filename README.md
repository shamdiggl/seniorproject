# Generating Synthetic Images Using Few Examples for Supervised Training

## Project Overview
This is the repository for my senior project. 
The project is in the **research phase**, focusing on understanding and leveraging modern generative techniques like **diffusion models** and their derivatives.
It is not very tidied up. 

## Repository Structure

### 1. Presentations
- Contains **slides** summarizing the key topics studied.
- Current focus: **Guided DÄ°ffusion**.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks
- **Toy Examples**: Simple implementations to understand and experiment with generative techniques.
- Topics covered:
  - Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
  - GANS
  - Basic diffusion model simulations.
  - Classifier and classifier free-guidance
