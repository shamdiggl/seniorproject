# Generating Synthetic Images Using Few Examples for Supervised Training

## Project Overview

This repository explores the use of synthetic image generation to improve supervised training, especially in scenarios where datasets are sparse. The project is in the **research phase**, focusing on understanding and leveraging modern generative techniques like **diffusion models** and their derivatives.

### Objectives
- Investigate the potential of generative models for creating synthetic training data.
- Study the core concepts and methodologies behind diffusion models.
- Develop toy examples to gain practical insights into generative processes.
- Lay the foundation for future algorithm development.
